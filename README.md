# rmTweet
This application uses the <a href="https://github.com/ChimeraCoder/anaconda">Anaconda</a> library to access a Twitter account via API keys and remove all tweets from it's home timeline. This application was originally designed as a free alternative to online applications such as <a href="https://www.tweetdeleter.com/">tweetdeleter</a> and will probably never be improved beyond it's existing functionality.
